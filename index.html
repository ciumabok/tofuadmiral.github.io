		I love participating in hackathons and creating my own projects in my free time. What attracts me most about software is the ability to sit down with nothing but your computer and your own wits, and be able to come up with a full working project in a matter of hours. It has truly revolutionized the creative process, and allows me to have an outlet for my creative tendencies.
